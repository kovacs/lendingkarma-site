# LendingKarma has been shutdown


- Unfortunately the time has come for LendingKarma to go. We've been in a "shutdown mode" for the last two years to allow users to be prepared to move on.

- Apologies for any inconvenience this has caused but hopefully you exported your loans via the export option.

- As of 3/17/2022 all access to the LendingKarma platform has been shutdown. If there are any questions from customers you can email us at admin@lendingkarma.com.
